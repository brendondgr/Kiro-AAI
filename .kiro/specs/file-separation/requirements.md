# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the current monolithic `index.html` file into a well-organized multi-file structure. The goal is to separate concerns by extracting CSS and JavaScript into dedicated files within a "scripts" folder, while maintaining the same functionality and user experience. This will improve code maintainability, readability, and follow standard web development practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code separated into distinct files, so that the codebase is more maintainable and follows standard web development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL maintain identical functionality to the current monolithic version
2. WHEN viewing the project structure THEN the system SHALL have HTML in the root, CSS in a scripts folder, and JavaScript in a scripts folder
3. WHEN making changes to styling THEN developers SHALL be able to modify only the CSS file without touching HTML or JavaScript
4. WHEN making changes to behavior THEN developers SHALL be able to modify only the JavaScript file without touching HTML or CSS

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean project structure with a scripts folder containing separated assets, so that the codebase follows conventional organization patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL have a "scripts" folder containing CSS and JavaScript files
2. WHEN the index.html file loads THEN it SHALL properly reference and load the separated CSS and JavaScript files
3. WHEN the application runs THEN all external dependencies (Tailwind CSS) SHALL continue to work as before
4. WHEN viewing the HTML file THEN it SHALL contain only structural markup and external file references

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the separated files to maintain the existing functionality, so that no features are broken during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all UI panels (Settings, Transcription, LLM Response, Console) SHALL render correctly
2. WHEN users interact with resizable panels THEN the drag-to-resize functionality SHALL work identically to the original
3. WHEN users toggle settings THEN all dropdown menus and toggle switches SHALL function as before
4. WHEN the application runs THEN all event listeners and JavaScript functionality SHALL work without modification
5. WHEN viewing the application THEN all styling and animations SHALL appear identical to the original

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper file naming and organization conventions, so that the separated files are easy to locate and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the scripts folder THEN CSS files SHALL use descriptive names ending in .css
2. WHEN examining the scripts folder THEN JavaScript files SHALL use descriptive names ending in .js
3. WHEN viewing file references in HTML THEN all paths SHALL be relative and correctly point to the scripts folder
4. WHEN the browser loads resources THEN there SHALL be no 404 errors or missing file references
