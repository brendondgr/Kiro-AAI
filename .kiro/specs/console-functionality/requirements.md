# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the console functionality in the AI Transcription and Response UI. The enhancement will integrate Flask and Jinja templating for server-side rendering and add new console commands for better user interaction and debugging capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Flask and Jinja templating into the application, so that I can render dynamic content server-side.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a Flask server
2. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL render the UI using Jinja templates
3. WHEN templates are rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing UI functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have a "clear" command for the console, so that I can reset the console output when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "clear" command is triggered from Python THEN the system SHALL remove all existing console messages
2. WHEN the console is cleared THEN the system SHALL add a single message stating "Console Cleared"
3. WHEN the clear command completes THEN the system SHALL maintain the console's scrolling behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have a "printl" command for the console, so that I can add new messages to the console log.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "printl" command is triggered from Python THEN the system SHALL add a new row to the console
2. WHEN a new message is added THEN the system SHALL format it as "> [{time}] {message}"
3. WHEN multiple messages are added THEN the system SHALL maintain the chronological order
4. WHEN a new message is added THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to the latest message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have a dedicated Python module for console operations, so that I can manage console functionality in a centralized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL initialize the console module from "scripts/python/console.py"
2. WHEN console commands are triggered THEN the system SHALL route them through the console.py module
3. WHEN the console module is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes without requiring a full application restart
