# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the refresh button functionality in the AI Transcription and Response UI. The enhancement will add console messages when refresh buttons are clicked in the Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and LLM cards, providing users with visual feedback about refresh operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see console messages when I click refresh buttons in the model cards, so that I can confirm the refresh action was recognized by the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refresh button in the Speech-To-Text card is clicked THEN the system SHALL display a message in the console stating "Speech-To-Text Models have been refreshed"
2. WHEN the refresh button in the Text-To-Speech card is clicked THEN the system SHALL display a message in the console stating "Text-To-Speech Models have been refreshed"
3. WHEN the refresh button in the LLM card is clicked THEN the system SHALL display a message in the console stating "LLM Models have been refreshed"
4. WHEN the refresh button in the audio settings dropdown (input device) is clicked THEN the system SHALL display a message in the console stating "Input Audio Devices have been refreshed"
5. WHEN the refresh button in the audio settings dropdown (output device) is clicked THEN the system SHALL display a message in the console stating "Output Audio Devices have been refreshed"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refresh button console messages to be consistent with the existing console message format, so that the user experience remains cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a refresh button is clicked THEN the system SHALL format the console message with a timestamp in the format "> [HH:MM:SS] {message}"
2. WHEN a refresh button is clicked THEN the system SHALL add the message to the console using the existing console functionality
3. WHEN a refresh button is clicked THEN the system SHALL ensure the console automatically scrolls to show the new message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refresh button console messages to be implemented in a way that maintains the existing application architecture, so that the code remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the refresh button console messages THEN the system SHALL use the existing Console class and its methods
2. WHEN implementing the refresh button console messages THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing WebSocket communication pattern for console messages
3. WHEN implementing the refresh button console messages THEN the system SHALL not disrupt any existing console functionality
